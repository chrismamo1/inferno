inferno
=======
This is the README for inferno. I promise that it will include more in the
future.

briefly, what needs to be done is:
 - finish implementing collision detection
 - finish/maintain unit tests
 - finish implementing the region-based coordinate system
 - comment and document everything in sight
 - develop detailed contracts and requirements for major components
 - get a Windows/DirectX frontend working
 - load 3D model files
 - license everything under LGPL or GPL if feeling generous
 - fix the extremely broken event system (this should be done before we add the
   DirectX (or any other) frontends.
 - fix the makefile (but I do get a feeling of satisfaction from seeing that
   I've written so much code that GCC actually has to work to compile it).
